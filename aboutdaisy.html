    perfectly-staged homes and a deep understanding of how to earn the best possible gains, she’s created immense
    returns for the communities she works within,– Irvine, Newport Beach, and Lake Forest. She specializes specifically

    to provide her clients with the best possible experience when it comes to the sometimes challenging process of
    selling a property. This is especially prominent when considering the importance of ingenuity of art, design,
    staging, and creativity in marketing, all skills Daisy brings to the table.
