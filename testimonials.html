      <h1>Rsa Y.</h1>
      <p>When we were out of the U.S during the selling process, Daisy spent lots of time and effort to bring up the
        best
        look of the house to the market. She â€˜s very experienced and knowledgeable to know how to present the house
        beautifully and attract more buyers. She worked very diligently and detailed with painters, gardeners, house
        cleaners, stagers to make sure they will create the best presentation to the house. Our house became the hot
        home
        in the market immediately after she put into the market and sold in 2 days with more than $70,000 above listed.
        The transaction process was very smooth and we closed the escrow in 10 days. We are truly thankful for her
        hardworking, professionalism and responsibility throughout the whole process. She will be the one I will highly
        recommend when you consider buying or selling your houses.

      <p>Daisy voluntarily asked to increase the listing price to $80,000 more than the price we agreed in the listing
        contract after she were aware the selling price was increasing rapidly on the street in the two weeks after we
        signed the contract and before we were about to list the property. She understands the market very well and are
        very much aware of the market change. She is very knowledgeable about the area and super responsive and
        attentive
        to our needs. Thanks for the team members behind her, we went through repair, staging, termite, escrow process
        easily from beginning to the end. In order to bring the best presentation to our house on the budget, relying on
        her experiences as stager before, she helped us make the secondary bedrooms stood out like a model home. She
        always did more than you expected and we are lucky we found such a reliable people to work with and sold our

      <h1>Ray C.</h1>
      <p>As a foreign investors, we don't have any experience with selling house in the U.S. Thanks for the patience and
        hardworking, she took care all the procedures from preparation to the escrow closed while we were not presented.
        Due to the outbreak of COVID again in my city, we couldn't go to the embassy for the notary service. And Daisy
        worked so diligently under the pressure and difficulty to solve the problem and got the escrow closed on time.
        Our
        investment house sold within 3 days with $80,000 over asking. We are very blessed to have Daisy and thank her
        for
        everything she has done for us.
