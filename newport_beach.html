      An affluent, seaside city with a thriving harbor

    </p>
    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">

      Newport Beach is an affluent and bayside community in Orange County. The city is home to the largest recreational
      harbor on the West Coast, so there’s plenty to do in and around the sea.
      <br />
      <br />
      Long thought to be too dangerous for ships to pass, the Newport Bay remained virtually unexplored until the end of
      the 19th century. In 1870, the first ship successfully docked in the new port — hence the name Newport.
      <br />
      <br />
      Newport Beach soon became a bustling community, and it was incorporated as a city in 1906. The growth was fueled
      by McFadden Wharf, a bustling wharf built in 1888 that was the largest business in Orange County at the time.
      Nowadays, Newport Pier stands where McFadden Wharf once stood.
      <br />
      <br />
      Due to its maritime roots, Newport Beach is a popular spot for sailors of all kinds — whether their vessel of
      choice is a humble fishing craft or a sleek and stylish sailboat.
      <br />
      <br />
      While land in the area went for $1 an acre in the late 19th century, the city is now affluent and desirable, with
      a typical home price is around $2.6 million. The population of Newport Beach is 85,694.
