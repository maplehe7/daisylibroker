      A lively city known for its focus on higher education

    </p>
    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
      Irvine has transformed over the century from sprawling, wide-open ranchland to a prosperous, diverse city that is
      home to one of California’s best public universities. The population of Irvine is around 273,000 people. Its
      proximity to Los Angeles and the natural beauty of the Pacific coastline make Irvine a popular destination for
      Southern Californians.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the 19th century, James Irvine bought 110,000 acres of land that he used to create the Irvine Cattle Ranch.
      Over the years, the ranchland became an orchard for olives and the citrus trees that Orange County is known for.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 1959, the sleepy, agricultural town of Irvine and Irvine Ranch underwent a significant transformation when the
      University of California purchased land to build a campus there. In the decades since, Irvine has grown from a
      sleepy college town of around 50,000 to a lively, small city with plenty of opportunities, educational or
      otherwise.
      <br />
      <br />
      Irvine is unique because it was planned to consist of smaller “villages” — neighborhoods throughout the city with
      their own distinct style, culture, and walkability. Some sought-after neighborhoods in the area are Orchard Hills,
      Eastwood, Stonegate, Altair, Great Park, Turtle Rock.
      <br />
      <br />
      Since the city’s layout was carefully planned in the 1950s and ‘60s, neighborhoods are varied and walkable. The
      architectural style in Irvine varies but boasts a large amount of midcentury California Modern style homes and
      Mediterranean-style homes.
      The median home price in Irvine is $861,600.
