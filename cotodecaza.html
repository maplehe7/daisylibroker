    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
      A rural and serene master-planned community </p>

    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
      Coto de Caza is an affluent Census Designated Place in Orange County. Its luxurious estates have made a splash on
      the silver screen twice — first in 1984 when the community was the center for the Olympics’ pentathlon events, and
      again in the 21st century as the backdrop of the popular reality show, the Real Housewives of Orange County.
      <br />
      <br />
      Like many neighborhoods in Orange County, Coto de Caza comes from humble beginnings. Originally a barley ranch,
      development in the area began in the middle of the 20th century. Coto de Caza was originally a private hunting
      reserve and equestrian club — the name Coto de Caza is Spanish for “hunting preserve.”
      <br />
      <br />
      With a population of 14,886, Coto de Caza has a close-knit sense of community. Residents enjoy the serenity and
      seclusion of the region — it’s easy to feel far from the hustle and bustle of urban life among Coto de Caza’s oak
      and sycamore groves.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ever since its days as a hunting preserve, Coto de Caza has maintained a reputation of exclusivity and luxury. It
      has fewer than 5,000 homes, all within its gates, so real estate is in high demand.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are many different architectural styles in Coto de Caza, but especially Spanish Colonial, Meditteranean, and
      Tuscan. The lots are known for being large and sprawling estates, and many have space for stables. The median home
      price in Coto de Caza is around $2.9 million.

          Residents of Coto de Caza aren’t just surrounded by the community’s gates, but they’re also encompassed by the
          gorgeous sycamore and oak groves in the Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park, which has over 6 miles of hiking,

          spot for local photographers.
          <br />

          24 acre complex with six riding arenas, easy access to Coto de Caza’s equestrian trails, and around 150 horses
          boarded in the stables. It was also the location for the equestrian pentathlon events during the 1984
