    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
      A tight-knit community surrounded by eucalyptus groves
    </p>

    <p class="aboutp" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
      Nestled within a eucalyptus grove and just a short drive from the sea, Lake Forest is a small and serene town in
      Orange County. It is situated southeast of the larger city of Irvine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Originally ranchland, like much of the region, Lake Forest was home to a small community called El Toro. At the
      turn of the 20th century, a resident of El Toro named Dwight Whiting planted 400 acres of eucalyptus trees,
      creating the forest that gives Lake Forest its name.
      <br />
      <br />
      In the middle of the 20th century, residential development began within the eucalyptus forest, and the quiet
      agricultural town of El Toro started to grow. In 1991, the community was officially incorporated as a city, and
      the name was changed from El Toro to Lake Forest to pay homage to the area’s natural beauty.
      <br />
      <br />
      Like its neighboring Orange County cities, Lake Forest was a master-planned community first developed in the
      mid-century. Because of this, it is well-designed and boasts a variety of homes, including single-family homes,
      luxury estates, condominiums, duplexes, and apartments.
      <br />
      <br />
      Lake Forest has a range of architectural styles, including the mid-century classic California Modern style and the
      newer Meditteranean style found in the Baker Ranch neighborhood. The median price of a home in Lake Forest is
      approximately $870,000, and the city’s population is around 87,000.

        <p>Heritage Hill Historical Park is a popular park with four restored historic buildings that help tell Lake

          For more ways to experience local history, head down to Modjeska Canyon to visit the Arden: Helena Modjeska
          Historic House and Gardens. Helena Modjeska was a world-renowned Shakespearean actress from Poland in the late
          19th century who moved to the brand new community of Orange County with her husband in 1876. She learned
          English and took the American stage by storm, debuting her U.S. career in San Francisco before touring the
          country.
          <br />
          <br />
          Madame Modjeska, as she was called, was a fascinating Orange County pioneer. She called her home the Arden
          House, and the woods around it the Forest of Arden, named after the famous enchanted forest in Shakespeare’s
          “As You Like It.” Her home is open to the public for guided tours, where visitors can learn about her
          fascinating life and career.
          <br />
          <br />
          Speaking of Madame Modjeska, Lake Forest residents can enjoy a performance at the local theater named in her
          honor, the Modjeska Playhouse.
